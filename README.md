# Humanitarian Crisis Analysis in Palestine

This project focuses on analyzing the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Palestine. The analysis involves tracking key indicators such as civilian fatalities, displaced populations, sexual violence, and the impact on humanitarian workers and organizations. The goal is to provide actionable insights to inform humanitarian response efforts and support decision-making processes.

## Project Overview

In this project, data related to the humanitarian situation in Palestine has been analyzed to better understand the following key aspects:
- **Displaced Civilians**: Tracking the number of people displaced due to the conflict.
- **Civilian Fatalities**: Identifying trends in civilian deaths resulting from the crisis.
- **Sexual Violence**: Analyzing the occurrence and impact of sexual violence during the crisis.
- **Humanitarian Workers**: Assessing the impact on aid workers and human rights organizations.
- **Most Affected Regions**: Pinpointing the regions most affected by the crisis.
- **Most Affected Human Rights Groups**: Pinpointing the Groups most affected by the crisis.


The data was processed using **Excel** for cleaning and aggregation, and interactive dashboards and reports were created using **Power BI** to visualize trends and patterns over time.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Extracted raw data and cleaned it to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Analysis of Key Indicators**: Focused on tracking fatalities, displacement, sexual violence, and the effect on aid organizations and workers.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Created visualizations to help interpret the data and present findings in an easily understandable format.
- **Insightful Recommendations**: Provided actionable recommendations for improving humanitarian responses based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, processing, and aggregation.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the raw and processed data files.
- **Reports**: Includes the Power BI files with visualizations.
- **Analysis**: Contains the analysis scripts and notes on the methodology used.
  
## How to Run

1. Download the data files and open the Power BI reports to view the visualizations.
2. If you want to explore the data further, use Excel to open and analyze the datasets.
3. The project doesn’t have an executable function, as it primarily focuses on data analysis and visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate more data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Automate data updates through APIs for real-time tracking.
- Expand the dashboard to provide more detailed insights on other humanitarian factors (e.g., healthcare, education).
